# CRUD_WITH_MERAKI_API_WITH_JSON


*   In this project I have performed simple CRUD(GET, POST, UPDATE & DELETE) operation on JSON file 
    where i have stored data which i have fetch from MERAKI api.


    


 *  1.GET:--while working with GET firstly i fetch data from meraki API and stored that 
    in JSON file.so here i am checking  wheather that fetched data is availbale in any file or not.
    if availvalble then we will get message that file is already exists if not then we need create that json file.


    2.POST:--while working with POST i create data to store in JSON file also taking care if ID of data is exists in JSON file so we should get message ID already exists if not then add th data in JSON file.


    3.UPDATE:--while working with UPDATE i update data which is already stored but now according to user choice if i want to modify in that specific data can modify and then store in the JSON file.

    4.DELETE:--while working with DELETE according to user choice if i want to remove  specific data from JSON file can delete and then modify data  in the JSON file.
